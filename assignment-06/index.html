		<h1>Assignment 6</h1>
		<p>This is a truly glorious web page filled with amazing things.</p>
		<p>Like <dfn title="German for 'sometimes'">manchmal</dfn>, one of my most favorite German words. It just sounds so... <em>smooth</em>.</p>
		<p>I like German. I like it <strong>so much</strong> that I have a hoodie that calls it <dfn title="German for epic"><q>episch</q></dfn>.</p>
		<p>Here are some other words I find enjoyable:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>також - 'also' in Ukrainian</li>		<!-- I wish I knew more Ukrainian... -->
			<li>flughafen - 'airport' in German</li>	<!-- 'Flugzeug' is airplane in German. It roughly transliterates to 'flight thing'. -->
			<li>ναι - 'yes' in Greek</li>				<!-- credit to my friend Maria who speaks fluent Greek for this one -->
				<ul>
					<li>I find this one funny, because it sounds like you're saying no</li>
					<li>pronounced 'nai'</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>

		<h2>Speaking of glorious things</h2>
		<p>BEARS! Did you really think I would forget about the bears??</p>

		<p>And right there in the attribution is an external hyperlink to <a href="https://placebear.com">placebear.com</a>, where all these amazing bears come from. Go figure.</p>
		<p>Have you heard about <a href="https://explore.org/fat-bear-week">Fat Bear Week</a>? It's an annual tournament to see which bear in some Alaskan national park gets the fattest for the winter, and Internet dwellers can vote on who they think will win. Unfortunately, Rockin' Rudy's does not sell Fat Bear Week stickers. I looked.</p>
