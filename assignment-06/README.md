In this week, we reviewed the structure of HTML source and basic, structural markup. We learned about lists — ordered, unordered, and dictionaries — and gawked at the sheer number of semantic markup tags. 

I will admit, I never understood the justification for using `<strong>` instead of just `<b>`, but the explanation that it is designed to convey a change in *meaning*, not just a change in *appearance* was very helpful. I never had a problem with `<em>` vs `<i>` though, because they're both about the same size. 

I didn't realize there were so many semantic tags, nor did I realize that the insane number of tags are actually automatically formated by the rendering engine. The fact that the renderer just knows what to do with addresses, blockquotes, etc. is honestly pretty nuts to me.

I have to say though, I am not a fan of how cluttered HTML source can get with really complex structure and markup. Markdown is just so simple, but HTML demands to be <sup>\*</sup><sub>\*</sub>\**quirky*\*<sub>\*</sub><sup>\*</sup> and makes things complicated.
