**Cluster Computing Update 2: New Plan!**

I appologize for turning this in a bit late. I got a bit too excited with the whole "let's make cool navbars", and decided to throw in some CSS and JavaScript to make my website usable on all kinds of devices.

I am so proud of my navbar. Literally every part of it just makes me happy. It is way better than the janky mess I had before...

I came into this class only knowing Python, and now I know a good amount of HTML, CSS, and a spidge of JavaScript. Remember how, at the start of the semester in the student introduction posts, I was hoping I wouldn't have to learn JavaScript? Now I want to learn *more* JavaScript.
