Cluster Computing Update 2: New Plan!

I appologize for turning this in a bit late. I got a bit too excited with the whole "let's make cool navbars", and decided to throw in some CSS and JavaScript to make my website usable on all kinds of devices.

I came into this class only knowing Python, and now I know a good amount of HTML, CSS, and a spidge of JavaScript. Remember how, at the start of the semester in the student introduction posts, I was hoping I wouldn't have to learn JavaScript? Now I want to learn *more* JavaScript.
