				<div class="block">
					<p>
						The TrustyCentre is a collection of related projects running on my "Trusty" cluster. Trusty is a small cluster of three Lenovo ThinkCentre M900 microcomputers running Rocky Linux as its OS and Docker as its containerization and clustering hypervisor. I named the cluster this simply because it sounds nice. "TrustyCentre" is thus a stylized portmanteau of "Trusty cluster" and "ThinkCentre", hence the European spelling.

					<p>
						I have been working on a bunch of side projects throughout the school year. Some of them are related to each other, others are not.

					<p>
						That statement is false. More specifically, it is <em>now</em> false. As I continued planning, pondering, and progressing on my cluster project (which I talked about in detail starting with <a href="/assignment-11/">this page</a>), most of my projects now relate to the cluster project in one way or another. This website is all about this TrustyCentre megaproject.

						This is an incredibly nerdy project. I am repurposing old computers to do things that the vast majority of people either don't care about, didn't know was possible, or both. I am teaching myself how to do some things I wouldn't have dreamt of just a few years ago. The end goal, to use it as part of my HomeLab, is one that many of my coworkers fully understand the appeal &mdash; and I work in IT.

						On top of that, have these fonts seemed at all recognizable to you? Unless you are a fellow tech nerd, probably not, as they are the fonts used in the <strong class="is-lenovo-font">Lenovo</strong> and <span class="is-thinkpad-font">ThinkPad</span> logos. The ThinkPad font, Haettenschweiler, is not quite perfect though, as the version used in the ThinkPad and ThinkCentre logos has a red, circular dot above the "I" instead of a square.\
