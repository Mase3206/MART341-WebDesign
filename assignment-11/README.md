# Assignment 11

Sorry for turning this in late. I completely spaced it until now.

## Elements

### Required
- **Internal CCS: check!** `/style.css` is used in Assignments 7 through 9, and `/new-style.css` is used in Assignments 10 and up.
- **Hover: check!** All links remove their underline on hover.
- **External Font: check!** I use "Atkinson Hyperlegible" via a Google Fonts `@import` in new-style.css.

### Optional:
- **Font style: check!**
	- some italics in a couple of places
	- I used colors to help keep explain the issue of time conflict in "The root of all my problems..."
- **Font weight: check!**
	- bold in a couple of places
	- a bunch of font weight stuff in the header
- **Text decoration: check!**
	- `span.inline-dfn`
		- adds a dotted underline
		- shows a light grey background and definition on hover
		- used to quickly define terms in a larger block of text
	- all the links have an underline that goes away on hover
- **Pseudos: check!**
	- `a:hover` removes underline
	- `a:visited` turns text into a shade of <span style="color:#494969;">slate blue</span> (`#494969`)
