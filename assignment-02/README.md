# Assignment-02 README
This README file has examples of Markdown elements.

Here's some text in *italics*.

Here's some in **bold**.

And here's some in ***both***.

Here's a line of code: `print('Hello, World!')`
â€” and here's that line with the full file for context:
```python
#!/bin/python3
print('Hello, World!')
name = input('What\'s your name?\n')
print('Well hi there,' name, '!')
```

- I
- can
- make
- lists
	- *(ooh, I like lists.)*

1. Or I can rank things,
2. like how the number two is better than one,
3. but three is better than both one and two,
4. and four is just happy to be here.

## I can make headings...
### within headings...
#### within headings...
##### within headings...
###### within headings... you get the image, like [this one](../assignment-01/mart341-workspace-screenshot.jpg)!

*Fun Fact!* I use Obsidian for note taking, which uses Markdown for everything, including links! It's awesome. You can take a look at it [here](https://obsidian.md), if you'd like.
