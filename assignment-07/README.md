# Assignment 7

This week, I decided to commit to an all-bears theme. I began by comparing black, grizzly, and polar bears. 

Bit by bit, I keep adding more elements to the page template. Today, for example, I added nav links to the root index and assignment readme.

## What we learned this week:
- How to set the size of images
- How to make tables
	- I used the quick table maker you linked to to help style mine
- How to make forms
	- basics
	- input types
		- text
		- textarea
		- radio buttons
		- checkboxes
	- buttons
	- value contraints
	- completion requirements
	- we didn't talk about scripts though, because that is siginficantly more advanced.
