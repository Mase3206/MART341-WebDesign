stuff


## Where I used the things
- `<div>`	
	- in the header (2x)
	- to mark the main content in the body
- `span`
	- in the first paragraph element to italicize (I couldn't think of another use)
- `<iframe>`
	- in the YouTube video
- `&__;` escape strings
	- in the website subtitle - en-dash --> `&ndash;`
	- in the navbar - em-space --> `&emsp;`
	- in the footer - Â© --> `&copy;`
