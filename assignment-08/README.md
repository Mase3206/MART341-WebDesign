# Assignment 8

## What I learned
- web browsers, host operating systems, and clients can be picky about what media file types are used
- iframes can be seriously finicky

## Where I used the new tags
- `<div>`	
	- in the header (2x)
	- to mark the main content in the body
- `,span.`
	- in the first paragraph element to italicize (I couldn't think of another use)
- `<iframe>`
	- in the YouTube video
- `&__;` escape strings
	- in the website subtitle - en-dash --> `&ndash;`
	- in the navbar - em-space --> `&emsp;`
	- in the footer - Â© --> `&copy;`
- `<video>`
	- in the running bears video
- `<audio>`
	- in the water stream audio

## Other things
- I cleaned up style.css. It was super clunky before.
- I applied my newfound knowledge of tables and de-janked the footer and made the header pretty.
